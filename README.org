#+TITLE: Vulnerable Driver Research

** Writeup

[TBD]

** Result

- result_firmware.org :: Discovered vulnerable drivers with firmware access (allowing arbitrary PIO & MMIO by non-admin users)

** Tool and Exploit PoCs

- ida_ioctl_propagate.py :: IDAPython script for automating the discovery of x64 vulnerable drivers
- ioctl_batch.py :: Python wrapper script to run in IDA batch mode for triage

Note: The script will not work for x86 drivers.

The exploit PoCs are located in the PoCs directory.
